#Question 9
#Write a program to calculate the monthly telephone bills as per the following rule: 
#Minimum Rs. 200 for upto 100 calls. 
#Plus Rs. 0.60 per call for next 50 calls. 
#Plus Rs. 0.50 per call for next 50 calls. 
#Plus Rs. 0.40 per call for any call beyond 200 calls. 

calls = int(input("Enter the number of calls made: "))

if calls <= 100:
    bill = 200  
elif calls <= 150:
    bill = 200 + (calls - 100) * 0.60  
elif calls <= 200:
    bill = 200 + (50 * 0.60) + (calls - 150) * 0.50 
else:
    bill = 200 + (50 * 0.60) + (50 * 0.50) + (calls - 200) * 0.40
